# Northcoders Final Project Backend

This repo is the backend repo for the Saviar Northcoders project group. The application that we built is a running app that will create a running route for the user, avoiding the most heavily polluted local areas. This backend builds the API that the frontend interacts with.

## Building the API

The API uses a NoSQL database (Mongo DB / Mongo DB Atlas) and is built using Mongoose and Express. The code was then hosted on Google Cloud Platform [here.](https://project-bhilt.appspot.com/api/)

The front end repo can be found [here.](https://github.com/BHILT-RunningApp/Front-End-React-Native-XCode)

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, clone this respository by running the code below in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/BHILT-RunningApp/BE-RunningApp.git

`cd` into the directory and install the required dependencies ( dotenv(^8.2.0), express(^4.17.1), mongoose(^5.7.13)) by running the code below in the directory:

    npm install

You will need to create a .env file which should be git-ignored and should look like the below code:

    DB_URI='mongodb+srv://<YOUR PROJECT NAME>:<YOUR PASSWORD>@<YOUR PROJECT NAME>-ze2oc.gcp.mongodb.net/<YOUR PROJECT NAME>?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

To seed your database on MongoDB Atlas you can run the `seed-atlas.js` file locally:

    node seed-atlas.js

TO run the spec file and test the endpoints, install mocha, chai, supertest, and faker. To run the tests use the command

    npm test

## Endpoints

The API has the following endpoints available to the user

```
GET /api/users
POST /api/users
PATCH /api/users
GET /api/pollution-points
GET /api/pollution-points/:id

```
